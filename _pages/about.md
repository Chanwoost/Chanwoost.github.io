I am a Quantitative Researcher at Citadel.

I received Ph.D. in Statistics minoring Computer Science at University of Wisconsin-Madison.  My advisor is Professor [Miaoyan Wang](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~miaoyan). My research interest lies at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and optimization. I mainly focus on developing statistical tools for analyzing matrix or tensor valued data. 

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program in September 2018,  I received B.S. in  Mathematical Science  and Statistics at  Seoul National University in South Korea.
