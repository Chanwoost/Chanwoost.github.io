## Abstract
Higher-order tensor datasets arise commonly in recommendation systems, neuroimaging, social networks, and more. In this article, we develop methods for estimating a possibly high rank signal tensor from noisy observation. We consider a
generative model that allows high rank tensors and incorporates many existing models
including low rank models, simple hypergraphon models, and single index models.
Comprehensive results are developed on both the statistical and computational limits
for the signal tensor estimation. We discover the intrinsic optimality gap between
statistical and computational rates. We show that a constrained least-square estimation provides the statistically optimal solution but with NP-hard computational
cost. Furthermore, we propose polynomial-time higher-order spectral algorithm that
achieves the computationally optimal rate. Numerical experiments and real data
applications are presented to demonstrate theoretical results and the practical merits
of our estimator.
